Building and installing LinSSID

To build from source you will need the proper development environment. At minimum you will need:
* build-essential
* libboost-regex-dev
* qt5-default
* qt5-make
* libqt5svg5-dev
* libqt5opengl5-dev
* qtchooser (if you already have qt4 and you want a dual development environment)

To build:
(1) Unpack the source archive.
(2) Open a terminal window and cd to the top level of the unpacked archive where you see the file linssid.pro
(3) Type:
    qmake
    make
    sudo make install

That should have compiled LinSSID, linked all, and installed LinSSID and a few of its ancillary files in the expected places in most Debian/Ubuntu and related distributions. If you're building for a different family of distributions you may need to modify the linssid-app/linssid-app.pro file to change some of the install destinations.
